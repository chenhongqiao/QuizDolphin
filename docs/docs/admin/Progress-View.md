Similar to the history page, you can also sort and search the data. However, due to technical limitations, it's currently impossible to view each attempts detail (questions, responses, etc) before the attempt ends.

That's it, we've covered all important information about the progress page, please nagivate to [User Management](User-Management.md) to learn how to manage users in the system.
